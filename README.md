### Predicting Cryptocurrency Prices during Economic Uncertainty:An Application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence .


<div align="justify"> Predicting cryptocurrency prices is challenging due to their high volatility. This challenge is more pronounced during economic uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2008 financial crises. While machine learning models can help in the prediction of cryptocurrency prices, their underlying conditions influencing the outcomes are sometimes unknown and there is a lack of consensus on appropriate techniques to use for technical prediction and circumstances under which they may be suitable. In this paper, we developed and applied an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) model to identify suitable analytical techniques and the optimized set of parameters for technical trading prediction based on the two most valuable cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin and Ethereum. </div>
